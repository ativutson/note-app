# Note App
This is a simple full CRUD app that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. Users must create an account using their name, email address, and password. 
Once they're signed up, they can log in to use the app and may log out anytime. You can access the app [here](https://sons-note-app.herokuapp.com/)
